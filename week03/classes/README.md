# React

## Basics.

### notes
  - After did run create-react-app command, we can remove some unused files, inside in src/, App.css, *.test.tsx, index.css, logo.svg, serviceWorker.ts. If we did it, is important remove the imports from removed files at index.tsx and App.tsx.
  Inside of public/, we can remove some files and keep just index.html and robot.txt, so at the index.html file, we have remove the references to these files.
